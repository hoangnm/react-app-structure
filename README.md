## Install
Install yarn and run
``` bash
yarn
```

## Usage


### Running the web app
```bash
yarn start
```

## Developer Guide
1. React: https://reactjs.org/.
2. React-Router: https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/example/basic.
3. Redux: http://redux.js.org/.
4. Saga: https://github.com/redux-saga/redux-saga.
5. Reselect: https://github.com/reactjs/reselect.
6. CSS - Inline styles with https://github.com/Khan/aphrodite.
### Linting and Code Formatting Conventions
ESLint with [eslint-config-airbnb](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-airbnb).

### Inspecting and Debugging
We can use two tools:
#### Chrome Debugger
Use extension for redux, https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension.

#### Reactotron
https://github.com/infinitered/reactotron.

## Developer Tools
### Storybook
Helps to build components independently: https://storybook.js.org/basics/quick-start-guide/.

### Blueprints

Generate a new dumb component / HOC Component (that has access to state)/ redux duck (actions/reducers) by using [redux-cli](https://github.com/SpencerCDixon/redux-cli)

```bash
npm install -g redux-cli
```
After installing, we can:

* generate duck file
```bash
redux g duck <name>
```
* generate container (smart) component
``` bash
redux g smart <name>
```

* generate dumb component
```bash
redux g dumb <name>
```

## App Architecture
<img src="diagram-redux-saga.svg" width="100%" height="400">

* Container components (**containers** folder): connect with redux store and dispatch actions to sagas or reducers.
* Dumb components (**components** folder): mainly describe UI, base on props, which are passed from container.
* Reducers (**store/reducers** folder): Receive actions (from sagas or containers) and return new state.
* Sagas (**store/sagas** folder): Listen actions from containers, handle side-effect (example: call remote api) and dispatch actions back to reducers.
* Selectors with **Reselect** (**store/selectors** folder): compute derived data from state, allowing Redux to store the minimal possible state (from **Reselect** documentation) and memorize data, avoid containers to re-render needlessly.

## TODO
- [ ] update storybook.
- [ ] flow type checking.
